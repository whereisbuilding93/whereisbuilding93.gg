If you've made it this far, GG.

SMS X for registration info for the event.  Everyone can find X, and 99% can find the SMS number to register for our April 1st hackathonacon (we're not fooling, we swear)

let X = 93, and let's assume the earth isn't flat.  And yes, X is an int and you didnt need typescript to know that.  building(x) you wont find on the microsoft campus map, unless you're willing to do some deep digging. 
You'd waste time building a lot of boring tunnels looking for building 93, 
unless you could connect a space elevator like a straw in an orange so it's aligned 
to a theoretical eclipse [coming to a theatre near you on 4.8.24 (which number is next this sequence? what if we're in UK date format of 8.4.24?)]
take this straight straw space elevator when poked into earth all the way so the tip of the straw is in the center of the core, that's point A. 
assume that inside of that straw is the diameter of the moon on both ends. extend that straw in your minds eye so the other end is inside the very center of of the sun. That's point C. 
Solve for point B coords on the surface of earth in the exact moment when the totality eclipse happens in such a way that the entire moon would be inside the space elevator straw. 
B is smack dab in the middle of that straw diameter.  You're gonna need B at some point to start digging.

A little history about the pale blue dot and how we map this thing. humans have brains. brains like numbers. and letters. and symbols. and sounds. and smells. and so on and so forth. 
lets KISS and think about numbers and math, or maths as we call it at the GGHQ

The history of 425 - a number to help a bunch of geeks navigate with ease. 

on April 27, 1997 we launched area code 425, but someone lost the keys that day, and somehow the public got access to that area code. strange.

let's take eye five and realize its south-north aligned, and that sets our west edge of our NA grid.  lets place 95 south-south on the right edge of our grid. Let's call that plain X. 
now don't confused that with the X from above, that's an int. 
This X is a fricken line segment, but it's not a straight line, its a fricken string because we are in the globe earth model for this history lesson. On ya, the "top" of our grid is 90, 
unless you find interstate 100 (that's the big cleared strip at the PCT northern end of the PCT terminus). Consider the southern border rough line interstate 0. There's some holes in this line, 
but we'll let mass media figure that one out.

And yes, good question, florida could have an interstate -10 and -20 some day. I guess with a -10 in florida, a blizzard is likely once in blue moon.

OK, so now we all have a basic undertanding that US interstate system (thanks teddy bear) are 10 apart for the last 2 digits consists of 5's going north/south, and 10's going east/west. 
On the west coast we dont like leading zeros, so we strip that off interstate 05 and just call in interstate 5. 

there's 48 states and 1 DC on the US continental grid. 

But ask any longhauler who still refuses to use nav, and they'll tell you that those state lines help us find where we are.

895? that's a belt loop around 95, 8 is a full circle. There can only be one 3 digit, unique segment per state. why? because that's the law. or maybe a policy. or rule of thumb? 
405? there's 3 of them, because there's 3 states with a 05 and and a 4 is a half-circle.   Well gee wiz, what about 205 in WA and or, 
it formed a half circle on the 5, so it should be 405 and that violates the role. technically a 2 is a quarter-arc touching a 5 in each state. Thanks columbia river for the assist!

405 in WA orients east, 405 in OR goes out west, and 405 in CA.. well nobody really knows WTF is up with that. Also in the old laws is that if you're from california, you call interestaes with a pronoun of "the", 
and to the rest of the states, that just sounds strange.

So, [eh|A, eye|I] digress.... 

425 area code is the only area code in the entire US grid that's fun. because it contains an easter egg from miss cornish. it's super useful to getting from the hidden MSFT building 93 to fluke hall on (state highway) 520 from the 4 (2|to) the 5. 

Now anyways, lets gett back to the phone number you need to txt:

Look at MSFT SEC filings dating all the way back in the machine for a 10 digital phone number, it's still live today. You can also find it on corporate office.  Or if you're too lazy to search, 
or you think we may be in control, we'll just tell you its 425-882-8080. This is a special number, we call it an amazonion prime number. It's a funny number, and all the AI in 2024 cannot
seem to find the froot of the toys and trees that lead us to choose this amazonion prime a long time ago. Believe it not, someone at MSFT messed up (or did they?) 
and before that fateful day of 4-27-97 they forgot to include the area code on the windows 95 box, a rare misprint from the 206 era. ultra rare collectors have a box that just says 882-8080 for MSFT support.   

Go ahead and give 425.882.8080 a call and ask MSFT support to find building 93. If you cannot find 93, then just add (93|X (the int, not the arc)) it to the 425 area code and send an SMS to that number already!
Even if you cannot handle that addition problem, you only have 998 guesses to try. some people are not good at math, that's ok too. We still need you at the hackaconathon

<b>capacity is limited to 400 for free food. If you're bringing a friend, they need to register too. If you want to sponsor food, let us know ahead of time. 
If you have not sent SMS to the secret number you will not be let in the convention center. We must get your 18+ first and last name into the exhibitor badge system or security will not let you in. </b>
If you're a git fan or learner, you can go ahead and request add a CSV to this repo so we can keep track of first and last names that have registered.  Congrats, you now just made an open source CRM!  
If you want to remain anon in the github repo, then just let us know at the secret SMS number and we won't add you to the CSV, but your exhibitor badge is gonna have your name it. 

No ID? No entry. Not our venue, not our rules.

Oh ya, rumor has it, some japanese guy buried some important keys in building 93 as part of his search for some friends. This guy buried the keys on the first 3 of the first 9 after the y2k bug was squashed.  it's as easy as ABCs & 123s to find the keys at the roots of 93.
